# CodeGraphy

> CodeGraphy **enhances** files connections inside VSCode and allows for **birds eye views** of each repository. It helps you to **visualize code hierarchy** at a glance, **seamlessly navigate and explore** your file hierarchy, **gain valuable insights** via a force based node graph UI, and so much more.

CodeGraphy is an [open-source](https://github.com/joesobo/CodeGraphy 'Open CodeGraphy on GitHub') extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Simply CodeGraphy helps you **better understand file connections**. With its force-based grpah you can get a completely different view of the architecture of your codebase and make quick informed decisions about where your code is "knotted" in the graph.
